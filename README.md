## AMINA JUSIC

I hold a MSc in Electrical Engineering from University of Sarajevo, a challenging and demanding degree that tested my resolve to persevere with this chosen path. Maths and problem solving is something I always enjoyed, had the affinity for and what I excelled at during university. I hope this background gives me the basis to excel as a developer too.

I have been a full time mum of two for the last 3.5 years and am ready to go back to full time employment. I believe I am a versatile and adaptable individual and a good team player with key strengths including analytical and problem solving mind, organisation, dedication and hard work.
