I hold a MSc in Electrical Engineering from University of Sarajevo, a challenging and demanding degree that tested my resolve to persevere with this chosen path.   
My education in engineering provided me with a problem solving mindset which led me to discover coding and I decided to work towards becoming a software developer. Going through Makers Academy, I learned the importance of writing test-driven clean code, gained confidence to work with the unknown and how to place that mindset in a practical context.

I am looking for a role where I can continue to learn and where I can further develop my coding skills in a fast paced and challenging environment.

## Skills

#### Communication and team work

I have particularly enjoyed pair programming at Makers, finding it an extremely effective learning practice and way of quickly working through problems.

At Makers, I really enjoyed being part of different project teams as well as coding as a pair. This gave me the opportunity to experience coding with people of different strengths, to work on XP values, and taught me to learn and grow with others. I really enjoyed discussing and tackling problems as a part of a team, as this showed me how individual talents feed into a successful project. I would love to be able to continue to pair in my first developer role.
